# 3 Part Definition to Continuity
## A function $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=a$ if and only if:

### 1. $f(a)$ is defined.
### 2.  $lim_{x\to a}f(x)$ exists.
### 3. $lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$ exists.

## Question types to note:
### Find the value of k that makes the function continuous at x = 2.

#### To do these:
1. Simplify the top function (without k)
2. Plug in the value of x to both. 
3. Set the equations equal to each other and then solve for K
