## If $f$ is continous on the closed interval $[a,b]$, $f(a) \neq f(b)$, and $k$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there is at least one number c in $[a,b]$ such that $f(c)=k$. If $f$ is continuous and $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are different signs, then the IVT guarantees the existance of a 0.

### Example: Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function on the closed interval $[-1,5]$. Which interval must contain a solution to f(x) = 3.
x | -1 | 2 | 4 | 5
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
$f(x)$ | 0 | 4 |9 | 15
--- | ---
 1. $f(x)$ is continous so IVT applies.
 2. $0 < 3 < 4$
 3. Therefore, interval $[-1, 2]$ must contain a solution to $f(x) = 3$.
