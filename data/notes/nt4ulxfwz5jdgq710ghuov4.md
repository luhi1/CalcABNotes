## If two functions (f and h) squeeze together at a particular point (a), then any function trapped between them will get squeezed to that same point.
---
## If $f(x)\leq g(x)\leq h(x)$ when $x$ is near $a$ (except possibly at $a$) and $lim_{x\to a}f(x) = lim_{x\to a}h(x) = L$, then $lim_{x\to a}g(x) = L$.
---
### Suppose there are three functions such that $f(x)\leq g(x)\leq h(x)$ when x is near 1. Given that $f(x) = 2x^3-x^2+5$ and $h(x) = 4-2(cos \pi x)$, find $lim_{x\to 1}g(x)$.

1. $2x^3-x^2+5 \leq g(x) \leq 4-2(cos \pi x)$
2. $lim_{x\to 1}2x^3-x^2+5 \leq lim_{x\to 1}g(x) \leq im_{x\to 1}4-2(cos \pi x)$
3. $6 \leq lim_{x\to 1}g(x) \leq 6$
4. $lim_{x\to 1}g(x) = 6$

## Important trig limits based on this theorem:

### $lim_{x\to 0}\frac{sin ax}{ax} = 1$

### $lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1 - cos x}{x} = 0$ (This one is signifcantly less used)

#### In problems, you will have to simplify coefficients to get to these trig limits. Once you do it right, you'll know because it all cancels out to a $const$.
