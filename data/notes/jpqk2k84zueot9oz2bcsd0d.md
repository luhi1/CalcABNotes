### $lim_ {x\to c} f(x) = L$
The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is $L$. It is $not$ the value of $c$.

### $lim_ {x\to c^-} f(x) = L$
The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ from the left is $L$.

### $lim_ {x\to c^+} f(x) = L$
The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ from the right is $L$.

### A general limit is one whose value $L$ is the same when $x$ approaches $c$ from left and right.
- A limit $DNE$ when it's left limit does not equal it's right limit.
