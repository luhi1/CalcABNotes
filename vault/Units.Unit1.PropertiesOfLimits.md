## The properties themsleves are self explanatory, just split one limit into two based on the original function

### ex) $lim_{x\to c}[f(x)\pm g(x)] = lim_{x\to c}f(x) + lim_{x\to c}g(x)$

### Trick questions with composites:

* ##### Remember, the limit can exist even if there is a discontinuity as long as the left hand limit equals the right hand limit.

* ##### Some questions will have two graphs, with one that is "DNE" after composition. 
    1. Look at the graph that isn't DNE.
    2. If it's concave up (both lines approaching from the bottom), your limit for the DNE graph is the one that is on the bottom.
    3. If it's concave down (both lines approaching from the top), your limit is the for the DNE graph is one that is on the top.
    4. If the graph has 1 line coming from up and 1 from down, it is actually DNE.
